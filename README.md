FlowCiao is a lightweight, user-friendly and extensible .NET state machine workflow that simplifies the creation and management of state machines in your applications. With FlowCiao, you can effortlessly define and control the flow of your application's logic, making it an ideal choice for managing workflows and state-driven processes. Start building robust and efficient state machines with ease. It will also contains a powerful server and a designer interface which will be explained later in the document.\
\
we prefer to use the term **"Flow"** instead of **"State Machine"**.
Why "Flow"? The term "Flow" intuitively captures the essence of a state machine. It signifies a dynamic process, a sequence of operations, or a progression of states. Just as water flows from one point to another, transitioning through various paths and channels, a Flow transitions from one state to another, guided by certain rules and conditions.

## Simplicity

Define your flow using an Easy-to-use and Fluent API

```csharp
builder
    .Initial(stepBuilder =>
    {
        stepBuilder
            .For(States.Idle)
            .Allow(States.Ringing, Triggers.Ring)
            .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Call)
    })
    .NewStep(stepBuilder =>
    {
        stepBuilder
            .For(States.Ringing)
            .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Pickup)
            .Allow(States.Idle, Triggers.Hangup)
    });
```

## Getting Started

To get started with FlowCiao, follow these steps:

1. Install FlowCiao via NuGet Package Manager.
2. Create your custom flow by implementing the `IFlowPlanner` interface.
3. Define your States, Transitions, and Triggers using the fluent API provided by FlowCiao.
4. Start managing states effortlessly in your application.

## Example

Here's a simple example of creating a flow for implementing a simple **Phone** machine with FlowCiao:

```csharp
public class PhoneFlow : IFlowPlanner
{
    public string Key { get; set; } = "phone";

    public IFlowBuilder Plan(IFlowBuilder builder)
    {
        builder
            .Initial(stepBuilder =>
            {
                stepBuilder
                    .For(States.Idle)
                    .Allow(States.Ringing, Triggers.Ring)
                    .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Call)
                    .OnEntry<PhoneOnEnterIdleActivity>()
                    .OnExit<PhoneOnExitIdleActivity>();
            })
            .NewStep(stepBuilder =>
            {
                stepBuilder
                    .For(States.Ringing)
                    .Allow(States.Busy, Triggers.Pickup)
                    .Allow(States.Idle, Triggers.Hangup)
                    .OnExit<PhoneOnExitIdleActivity>();
            });

        return builder;
    }
}
```

Add FlowCiao to your project:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddFlowCiao();
```

Then **Build** your desired flow using `Ciao()` and **Fire** it:

```csharp
var flowBuilder = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IFlowBuilder>();
var flow = flowBuilder.Build<PhoneFlow>();

var flowOperator = scope.ServiceProvider.GetService<IFlowOperator>();
await flowOperator.CiaoAndTriggerAsync(flow.Key, Triggers.Call);
```

And that's it!

## And also Persistency if required ðŸ’ª

If there is a need to persist your flows for long-running processes, you can connect FlowCiao to database providers (For now, Sql Server and other providers very soon!).
Otherwise, as long as your application is running, We track the status and data of all of your running flows. So no wories:)

```csharp
builder.Services.AddFlowCiao(settings =>
{
    settings
        .Persist(persistenceSettings =>
        {
            persistenceSettings.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("FlowCiao"));
        });
});
```

## Activities

In FlowCiao, an `Activity` is a custom class that you can create and use as part of your flow's process. These objects play a crucial role in defining the behavior of your flow when entering or exiting a state.

### OnEntry and OnExit

`OnEntry` and `OnExit` are two key methods associated with each State in your flow and can be declared as you've seen earlier in PhoneFlow. They represent the actions that should be performed when a State is entered (`OnEntry`) and when a State is exited (`OnExit`).

### Custom Activities

With FlowCiao, you have the flexibility to define your own `Activity` classes. These custom classes can encapsulate any logic or functionality you need to execute as part of the `OnEntry` or `OnExit` process. This could include anything from logging and data validation to complex business logic. For creating such activities, you should implement the `IFlowActivity` interface and override the `Execute` method. Here is an example:

```csharp
public class PhoneOnExitIdleActivity : IFlowActivity
{
    public void Execute(FlowStepContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Phone exited idle state: caller id: {context.Data["CallerId"]}");

        context.Data["Location"] = "USA";
    }
}
```

### Passing Data
As you can see, the `Execute` method takes a `FlowStepContext` parameter, which is a special object that contains a **dictionary**. This dictionary can be filled with any data you want to pass between activities during a transition.
You can then initialize this data and pass it in the process of triggering your flow:
```csharp
var data = new Dictionary<object, object>
{
    { "CallerId", 12134664789 }
}; 
await flowOperator.CiaoAndTriggerAsync(flow.Key, Triggers.Call, data);
```

***Limitaion**: this data is only available during a transition and will not be accessible in the next Trigger*

## Some Features

- **Simple & Fast Development**: Speed up your flow development with a user-friendly fluent API.
- **Trigger-Packed Transitions**: Trigger transitions with ease to move between states effortlessly.
- **Dynamic On Entry and On Exit Activities**: Enhance states with custom activities upon entry and exit of each state for more responsive and intelligent state management.
- **Persistence Power**: Achieve persistency with support for common database providers.
- **Flow Management**: There are plenty of additional functionalities for better managing your Flows. Here are some of them
    - You can monitor the current running or finished instances of your flow using the following command
        ```csharp
        var flowService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<FlowService>();
        var flow = await flowService.GetByKey(key: key);

        var flowInstanceService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<FlowInstanceService>();
        var flowInstances = await flowInstanceService.Get(flow.Id);
        ```
    - Instead of using `CiaoAndTriggerAsync()`, you can First initialize a new instance of your Flow using `Ciao()` and then Trigger it whenever you wish using `TiggerAsync()` which accepts the same arguments as `CiaoAndTriggerAsync()`
        ```csharp
            var flowOperator = scope.ServiceProvider.GetService<IFlowOperator>();
            var flowInstance = await flowOperator.Ciao(flow.Key);
            var result = await flowOperator.TriggerAsync(flowInstance, Triggers.Call);
        ```
